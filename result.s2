The first question is : what ?

My version of them personally tell them .
&quot; Before I die , I wanted to steal . &quot;
But why are that information ?

The question , &quot; Why did she stay in ? &quot;
They kill our livestock .
Thank you .
You can see the story that &apos;s going to be .
You don &apos;t know it &apos;s interesting to know how she &apos;s seeing her story .
So finally , what helped it help ?
Because the police doesn &apos;t keep the environment in clean water .

One morning I can &apos;t forget .
That &apos;s seven hours old when I was wearing sleeping sleeping .

Why science involves us .
Nine percent . Yes , a <unk> .
I &apos;m absolutely desperate .
He told me about two things .

That means it can be possible .
And the box rings to light light .
And I think this is why lions in the National Park in the West State .
Now , I live in New Orleans , and I love New Orleans .
